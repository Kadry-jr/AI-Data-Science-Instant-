## 1. T-Test:

Used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two independent groups.

Example: Comparing the mean test scores of students who received different teaching methods.

## 2. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):

Used to compare the means of three or more independent groups to determine if at least one group differs significantly from the others.

Example: Comparing the mean weights of mice fed with three different diets.

## 3. Chi-Squared Test:

Used to test the association between categorical variables in a contingency table.

Example: Testing whether there is a significant association between gender and smoking status.

## 4. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Pearson's r):

Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.

Example: Examining the correlation between age and blood pressure.

## 5. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient:

Non-parametric measure of the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables.

Example: Assessing the correlation between the ranks of students in math and science exams.

## 6. Regression Analysis:

Used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable.

Example: Predicting house prices based on factors like size, location, and number of bedrooms.

## 7. Paired T-Test:

Used to compare the means of two related groups (paired samples).

Example: Comparing the pre-test and post-test scores of participants in an intervention program.

## 8. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test:

Non-parametric test used as an alternative to the paired t-test when the assumption of normality is violated.

Example: Comparing the median reaction times before and after a cognitive training program.

## 9. Mann-Whitney U Test:

Non-parametric test used to compare the distributions of two independent groups.

Example: Comparing the median incomes of employees in two different companies.

## 10. Kruskal-Wallis Test:

Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA used to compare the medians of three or more independent groups.

Example: Comparing the median salaries of employees across multiple industries.
