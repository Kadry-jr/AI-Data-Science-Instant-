  |Sampling Technique | Description | When to Use  |
----------------------|-------------|--------------|
|Random Sampling |Random sampling is a method where every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. It involves drawing samples without any specific pattern or bias, ensuring that each member of the population has a fair opportunity to be included in the sample. Random sampling is the gold standard for achieving representativeness and minimizing selection bias in statistical inference.|Random sampling is suitable for homogeneous populations where there are no distinct subgroups or patterns that need to be captured. It is commonly used in opinion polls, surveys, and experiments to obtain unbiased estimates of population parameters.|
|Stratified Sampling| Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups called strata based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income level). Samples are then randomly selected from each stratum in proportion to their size in the population. Stratified sampling ensures representation from all subgroups, thereby improving the precision of estimates and allowing for comparisons across different strata.|Stratified sampling is appropriate when the population exhibits heterogeneity or variability across specific characteristics of interest. It is commonly used in market research, social science studies, and public opinion polls to ensure balanced representation of diverse groups within the population.|
|Systematic Sampling|Systematic sampling involves selecting individuals from the population at regular intervals after randomly selecting a starting point. The interval (sampling interval) is determined by dividing the population size by the desired sample size. Systematic sampling is a straightforward method that offers better coverage than simple random sampling while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.| Systematic sampling is suitable for large populations that are organized in a systematic or sequential manner. It is commonly used in quality control inspections, customer surveys, and administrative data collection processes.|
|Cluster Sampling|  Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters or groups based on geographic, administrative, or natural boundaries. Random clusters are then selected, and all individuals within the chosen clusters are included in the sample. Cluster sampling is cost-effective and practical for populations that are widely dispersed or difficult to access individually.|Cluster sampling is appropriate when the population is naturally grouped into clusters, such as households in a neighborhood, students in schools, or patients in hospitals. It is commonly used in epidemiological studies, market research, and socio-economic surveys.|
|Convenience Sampling|Convenience sampling involves selecting individuals who are readily available or easily accessible to the researcher. Participants are chosen based on convenience rather than random selection, leading to a non-probabilistic sample that may not be representative of the population. Convenience sampling is quick, inexpensive, and convenient but may introduce bias and limit the generalizability of findings.| Convenience sampling is used when time, resources, or access to the population are limited. It is commonly employed in pilot studies, exploratory research, and situations where obtaining a random sample is impractical or infeasible.|
|Snowball Sampling|Snowball sampling involves recruiting initial participants who then refer additional participants from their social networks or communities. The sample "snowballs" in size as each participant recruits others, allowing researchers to reach populations that are difficult to access through traditional sampling methods.|Snowball sampling is appropriate for studying hidden, marginalized, or stigmatized populations where conventional sampling techniques may not be effective. It is commonly used in studies of rare diseases, illegal activities, and minority populations.|
|Quota Sampling|Quota sampling involves selecting individuals based on pre-defined quotas to ensure representation from different demographic groups or strata. Researchers set quotas based on specific characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status and then recruit participants who meet these criteria until the quotas are filled.|Quota sampling is used when researchers need to achieve proportional representation of certain characteristics within the sample. It is commonly employed in market research, opinion polling, and advertising to ensure that the sample reflects the demographic composition of the target population.|
