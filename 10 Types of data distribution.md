## 1. Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):

Definition: A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution where the data clusters around the mean, with most values falling near the center and fewer values toward the tails.

Example: Heights of adult males in a population.

## 2. Uniform Distribution:

Definition: All outcomes are equally likely, and data is spread evenly across the entire range.

Example: Lottery numbers selected from a pool of integers.

## 3. Exponential Distribution:

Definition: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

Example: Time between arrivals of customers at a service center.

## 4. Binomial Distribution:

Definition: Represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes.

Example: Number of heads obtained from flipping a coin multiple times.

## 5. Poisson Distribution:

Definition: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming a constant rate of occurrence.

Example: Number of cars passing through a toll booth in an hour.

## 6. Lognormal Distribution:

Definition: Results from taking the natural logarithm of a normal distribution, typically representing positively skewed data.

Example: Distribution of stock prices.

## 7. Gamma Distribution:

Definition: Generalizes the exponential distribution and is often used to model the time until k events occur in a Poisson process.

Example: Time until a machine part fails.

## 8. Chi-Squared Distribution:

Definition: Arises in the context of chi-squared tests and is used for hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation.

Example: Test statistic in a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test.

## 9. Beta Distribution:

Definition: Describes the distribution of probabilities in Bayesian statistics, constrained between 0 and 1.

Example: Distribution of probabilities of success in clinical trials.

## 10. Weibull Distribution:

Definition: Used to model reliability data, representing the time until failure of a system or component.

Example: Time until a lightbulb burns out.
